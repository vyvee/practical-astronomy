# Practical Astronomy

Implementations of astronomical algorithms. Main source is \[Peter11\].

Aims to implement algorithms to calculate *approximate* (and NOT high precision) positions of solar system objects.
In particular, aims to use formulae or algorithms that do not involve large number of arithmetic operations.
Currently, the main reference is \[Peter11\].

For high precision calculations, you are recommended to check \[Jean99\], \[VOSP87\], \[XEphem\], etc.

## Completed

- Julian Date Conversion

## TODOs

- Project is still in VERY EARLY stage.
- Too many to list down!
