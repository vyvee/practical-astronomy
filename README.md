# Practical Astronomy

Implementations of astronomical algorithms with C++17.

Aims to implement algorithms to calculate positions of solar system objects with high accuracy.

The project is still in EARLY stage.

## Features

- Angle: Degree, Radian, DMS, HMS
- Date: Julian Date, Calendar (TT), Delta-T
- Earth: Obliquity, Nutation
- Solver: Kepler's equation
- Develops with GCC

## TODOs

- NEXT: VSOP87 for Earth
- Positions of Sun, Moon, and other planets (with [VSOP87], [LEA-406], etc.) 
- Time: UT
- Coordinate Transformation
- Better error handling: Invalid julian date, invalid parameters, algorithms not applicable and not available for the time interested, etc.
- C++: Better and more use move semantics, noexcept, etc.
- Many others...
