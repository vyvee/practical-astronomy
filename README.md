# Practical Astronomy

Implementations of astronomical algorithms. Assumed C++17 and tested with GCC.

Aims to implement algorithms to calculate positions of solar system objects with moderate accuracy, or to about a few arcseconds.
Currently, the main references include \[Jean99\], \[Peter11\].

Does not aim to provide results with extremely high accuracy. For highly accurate results, you are recommended to refer to \[VOSP87\], \[XEphem\], etc.

## Completed

- Angle: Degree, Radian, DMS, HMS
- Date: Julian Date, Calendar (TT), Delta-T
- Earth: Obliquity, Nutation
- Sun: Position
- Solver: Kepler's equation

## TODOs

The project is still in EARLY stage.

- Change to use more algorithms in \[Jean99\] which provide more accurate results
- Moon: Position
- Time: UT
- Planets: Position
- Coordinate Transformation
- Better error handling: Invalid julian date, invalid parameters, algorithms not applicable and not available for the time interested, etc.
- C++: Better and more use of constexpr, move semantics, noexcept, etc.
- Many others...
